Before running the code, libraries are needed to be downloaded and imported

Prerequisites
- Python 3.11
- Python Interpreter 3.8+
- Graphviz for windows, https://graphviz.org/download/

This project contains "requirements.txt" file that contains all used libraries.

There are various ways to do so:

1. Pip install via cmd

2. Use the "install_dependencies.bat" file to automatically call pip install

3. Let your chosen IDE (Pycharm for example) install it for you if it has that functionality

HOW TO RUN:
Simply open main.py and run, it should show all the necessary plots and graphs. 
However, if chosen IDE does not have Sciview, all the plots and graphs are in folder "plot_graphs"
